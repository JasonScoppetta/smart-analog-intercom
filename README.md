This script is designed to work with a **Raspberry Pi** and a **Terraneo MP10WS**. However, it can basically be used with any multi-wire video door phone (even two-wire with the appropriate modifications).

### Hardware requirements
* Raspberry Pi 3 ( with at least 5 free GPIOs )
* A USB sound card adapter that has at least one microphone input and one headphone output ( Better if it has a preamp input )
* 6 5v Relays ( I used a card with 4 relays and a 2 relay to make it fit into the case of the door phone )
* A 22R resistor
* Wires and/or duponts

Only if you want the get the camera streaming
* AV to HDMI adapter ( It can be found cheap on amazon )
* HDMI to CSI-2 for Raspberry Pi ( I am using the one with Toshiba TC358743XBG )

### Wire up
